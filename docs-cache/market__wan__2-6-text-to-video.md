      deprecated: false
      description: >-
        High-quality video generation from text descriptions powered by Wan's
        advanced AI model


        ## Overview


        Generate videos directly from text descriptions using the Wan 2.6 Text
        to Video model. This model creates dynamic video content from natural
        language prompts without requiring any input images. Output: a 16:9
        video with generated audio (portrait output is not available).


        ## Usage Tips


        :::info[]

        - Supports both Chinese and English prompts

        - Maximum prompt length: 5,000 characters

        - Minimum prompt length: 1 character

        - Choose appropriate duration and resolution based on your needs

        ## Query Task Status


        After submitting a task, use the unified query endpoint to check
        progress and retrieve results:

           Learn how to query task status and retrieve generation results
        </Card>


        ::: tip[]

        For production use, we recommend using the `callBackUrl` parameter to
        receive automatic notifications when generation completes, rather than
        polling the status endpoint.

                    - System will POST task status and results to this URL when
                    generation completes

                    - Callback includes generated content URLs and task
                    information

                    - Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with
                    JSON payload containing results

                    - Alternatively, use the Get Task Details endpoint to poll
                    task status

                          In a hyperrealistic ASMR video, a hand uses a knitted
                          knife to slowly slice a burger made entirely of
                          knitted wool. The satisfyingly crisp cut reveals a
                          detailed cross-section of knitted meat, lettuce, and
                          tomato slices. Captured in a close-up with a shallow
                          depth of field, the scene is set against a stark,
                          matte black surface. Cinematic lighting makes the
                          surreal yarn textures shine with clear reflections.
                          The focus is on the deliberate, satisfying motion and
                          the unique, tactile materials.
